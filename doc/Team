The team as a whole:

Stavros not being part of the team was a big issue. We tried numerous times
to contact him through email and he never responded to any of the emails.
Every time something was due, he would email us and say that we should get
together to work on it, but wouldn't respond when we sent out the schedules
of when we should meet. It is lucky that he was not in charge of something
integral to our project.
