The team as a whole:

Stavros not being part of the team was a big issue. We tried numerous times
to contact him through email and he never responded to any of the emails.
Every time something was due, he would email us and say that we should get
together to work on it, but wouldn't respond when we sent out the schedules
of when we should meet. It is lucky that he was not in charge of something
integral to our project.

Russ and Christine had good communication. We used Google Wave and email and
spoke in person. We mapped out our API in Google Wave before starting and
discussed how we were going to do things.

Christine should have come for help sooner and there may have been time to
figure out what was wrong. We should have tested the project in the DSL before
the day of the demonstration, as all the filesystem work was done on an
emulator.
