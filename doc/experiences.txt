Russell Harmon:
	My team was very disconnected. Within the first few weeks, myself and
	Christine had formally defined the API between her driver and my
	filesystem. After that, we were just going to go and work on it and
	integrate when we were done. It wasn't until week 10 that I found out
	that she had not been able to get anything working and so had stopped
	working on it. Were I taking this class over, I would have had
	scheduled weekly meetings where my entire team worked on the operating
	system together.

	As for myself, I am mostly satisfied with my work. The only major
	thing I would have changed is that I would have tested on the DSL
	machines long ago rather than on the day of my presentation.

	Had I had more time, some things I would have implemented, in order of
	precedence include:
	- Resizable data
	- An on-disk free list (which would allow reclamation of deleted data
	  without defragmentation).
	- Randomization of the placement of allocated data (don't just grow
	  the disk linearly). This would help to eliminate fragmentation.
	- Defragmentation
