IDE Driver
Christine Viets

The program find the address of the PCI BIOS. Then, it is
supposed to do a far call to that address to gain access to
the BIOS. I tried a lot of different ways to access this
address, but none of them have worked.

The archlinux solution is to store the code segment and the
address of the BIOS in memory, and store that memory address
in %edi, then do "lcall (%edi)" Another version uses
"lcall *(%edi)". I tried both of these and the each generate
General Protection Faults or return with an error. I also
tried to use "pushl %cs; call %edi", where %edi contains the
address of the BIOS, and this did not work. I am not sure
what I am doing wrong with this, but it means that my driver
cannot work, as I cannot locate the address of the hard drive
I want to use.

I suspect that the reason the lcall code does not work may have
something to do with the call gate, but I'm really not sure at
all. In any case, I don't think the call gate needs to be set
up when using the regular call, but those do not work either.

As I spent the majority of my time trying to solve this problem,
I did not write my side of the interface between the hard drive
and the filesystem as it is useless without the driver working.
I've been trying to fix it up until right now when I'm delayed
at the airport in Charleston, but I suppose I'll start writing
the actual read/write code now, even though I don't think I can
test it without a working driver. I spoke with Russ and he said
that he can demonstrate his code without mine working since he
write a simple interface for testing purposes.
