** Description:	Structures and functions to support dynamic memory
**		allocation within the OS.
**
**		The list of free blocks is ordered by address to facilitate
**		combining freed blocks with adjacent blocks that are already
**		free.
**
**		All requests for memory are satisfied with blocks that are
**		an integral number of 4-byte words.  More memory may be
**		provided than was requested if the fragment left over after
**		the allocation would not be large enough to be useable.
